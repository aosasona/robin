# Robin

> [!WARNING]
> The repo you are currently looking at contains an alpha-ish release and is not the right tool for you if you are not willing to put up with breaking changes from time to time and barebones documentation.
> Eventually, I intend to take the learnings from this duct-taped version to figure out the appropriate APIs and then rewrite to focus on a cleaner (and honestly, saner) code. I do not have the time to work on this heavily right now, **use at your own risk**.

## Introduction

Robin is an experimental and new(-ish) way to rapidly develop web applications in Go, based on another project; [mirror](https://github.com/aosasona/mirror).

It aims to provide an experience similar to those available in other langauges like [Rust (rspc)](https://rspc.dev) and [TypeScript (trpc)](https://trpc.io); allowing you to move fast without worrying about writing code to handle HTTP calls, data marshalling and unmarshalling, type definitions etc. while keeping both the server and client contracts in sync. Enough said, let's see some code.

# Example

## Server (Go)

Defining your procedures in the Go application/server is as simple as creating functions as you normally would (with a few known and unknown limitations) as shown below.

```go
// TODO

```

## Client (TypeScript)

This is how you would use the generated client code in your TypeScript project.

```typescript
// TODO
```
