# Robin

> [!WARNING]
> The repo you are currently looking at contains an alpha-ish release and is not the right tool for you if you are not willing to put up with breaking changes from time to time and likely performance dips compared to your current setup.
> Eventually, I intend to take the learnings from this duct-taped version to figure out the appropriate APIs and then rewrite to focus on a cleaner (and honestly, saner) structure with better performance.

## Introduction

Robin is an experimental and new(-ish) way to rapidly develop web applications in Go. It aims to provide an experience similar to those available in other langauges like [Rust (rspc)](https://rspc.dev) and [TypeScript (trpc)](https://trpc.io); allowing you to move fast without worrying about writing code to handle HTTP calls, data marshalling and unmarshalling, type definitions etc while keeping both the server and client contracts in sync. Enough said, let's see some code.

# Example

## Server (Go)

```go
// TODO

```
